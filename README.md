# Movie Browser App

Welcome to the Movie Browser App! This React application allows users to browse and search for movies, providing information about various films.

## Features

- Browse a list of upcoming movies with details.
- Search for movies by title.
- View detailed information about a specific movie.
- The project is build using react-query and zustand and it also supports infinite querying on the home page.
- If I had some more time I would refactor the movie-details page because most of the items in it can be reusable.
  and also I would add new filters for filtering movies by genre and sorting etc.
